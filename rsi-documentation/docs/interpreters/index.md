# Interpreters

## Managing the interpreters

Your client can invite its own interpreters or book from our database.

### Using own interpreters
Each interpreter will have access to an interpreter account. Your client can invite them by adding their email to the [interpretation manager](/interpretation-player/index) when creating an event.


### Booking our interpreters
Your client can book from our +5K professional interpreters database.
