# Roomname

When creating an event with the [`interpretation-manager`](/interpretation-manager/index.html) you will get in response a `roomname`.

#### How to use the roomName, two solutions : 

* 1 You add the roomName as propertie. [more](props.html)

* 2 You add the `roomname` as a **query parameter** on the **audience page** you want to use Remote Simultaneous Interpretation for that particular event.

  * **Url Path :**
  * www.your-application/your-audience-page?`rsi-roomname=abcd`

That roomname will allow our `interpretation-player` to know which event to interprete.
