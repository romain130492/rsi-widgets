# Roomname

When creating an event with the [`interpretation-manager`](/interpretation-manager/index.html) you will get in response a `roomname`.

That `roomname` has to be added as a **query parameter** on the **audience page** you want to use Remote Simultaneous Interpretation for that particular event.

**Url Path :**
www.your-application/your-audience-page?`rsi-roomname=abcd`


That roomname will allow our `interpretation-player` to know which event to interprete.
