# Akkadu Rsi Api
Enhance your Virtual Event Platform with `Remote Simultaneous Interpretation` (RSI).



#### What's Remote Simultaneous Interpretation ?
`Simultaneous interpretation` is the process of translating speech from one language to another in real-time. ðŸŽ‰


By using our Api, you will now be able to have event in multiples languages (up to 2 languages). 

You can use your own interpreter or we can provide you with our interpreter. See more in the section <!-- [managing interpreters](/interpreters/index). -->
