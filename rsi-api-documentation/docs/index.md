# Akkadu RSI API
Enhance your Virtual Event Platform with `Remote Simultaneous Interpretation` (RSI).



#### What's Remote Simultaneous Interpretation ?
`Simultaneous interpretation` is when an interpreter translates the message from the source language to the target language in real-time. Unlike in consecutive interpreting, this way the natural flow of the speaker is not disturbed and allows for a fairly smooth output for the listeners. ðŸŽ‰


By using our API you can stream your events in multiples languages. 

You (our your client) can use own interpreters or, we can provide our interpreters. See more in the section [managing interpreters](/interpreters/index).
